# LIGHT-SENSITIVE-RELAY
switching relay using ldr

so basically this code here can help you in making things like a automatic street light or a light bulb that glow when the other light in the room
are turned off. im using ldr which stands for light dependant resistor and a relay, our electrical appliance is connected to relay.
the ldr pick up the change in light and arduino then trigger the relay , simple as that.
