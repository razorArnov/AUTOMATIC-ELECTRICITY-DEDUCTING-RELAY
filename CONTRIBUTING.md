i have use arduino uno in this project but we can use nano or pro mini to decrease the project size.
code will be same, ldr and relay are other two thigs that we need.
i have use a single 5v relay not the module. in module we connect 3 wire, one for input and other two are 5v and gnd. instead of adding 5v wire attach the 
input wire (pin2) to the positive terminal of relay and gnd to negative terminal and bazinga your relay will work just fine.
